What did the Nature Medicine paper report?,the construction of a chimeric CoV with a bat CoV S gene (SHC014) in the backbone of a SARS CoV that has adapted to infect mice (MA15) and is capable of infecting human cells
Why does the claim lack any scientific  basis?," because of significant divergence in the genetic sequence of this construct with the new SARS-CoV-2 (>5,000 nucleotides)."
How was the mouse-adapted SARS virus (MA15) generated?,by serial passage of an infectious wildtype SARS CoV clone in the respiratory tract of BALB/c mice.
How did  the SARS-CoV gain elevated replication and lung pathogenesis in aged mice ?,due to six coding genetic mutations associated with mouse adaptation. 
Why is it likely that MA15 is highly attenuated to  replicate in human cells?,due to the mouse adaptation.
"Why were civets proposed to be an intermediate host of the bat-CoVs, capable of spreading SARS CoV to humans?","t was proposed that the S gene from bat-derived CoV, unlike that from human patients-or civetsderived viruses, was unable to use human ACE2 as a receptor for entry into human cells "
What was the finding  in 2013?,"several novel bat coronaviruses were isolated from Chinese horseshoe bats and the bat SARS-like or SL-CoV-WIV1 was able to use ACE2 from humans, civets and Chinese horseshoe bats for entry "
 Why is it proposed that some bat SL-CoVs may be able to directly infect human hosts?,Combined with evolutionary evidence that the bat ACE2 gene has been positively selected at the same contact sites as the human ACE2 gene for interacting with SARS CoV [
What was done to test if  an intermediate host may not be necessary and that some bat SL-CoVs may be able to directly infect human hosts. T, the exact S gene from bat coronavirus SL-SHC014 was synthesized and used to generate a chimeric virus in the mouse adapted MA15 SARS-CoV backbone. 
What were the results of this test?,"The resultant SL-SHC014-MA15 virus could indeed efficiently use human ACE2 and replicate in primary human airway cells to similar titres as epidemic strains of SARS-CoV. While SL-SHC014-MA15 can replicate efficiently in young and aged mouse lungs, infection was attenuated, and less virus antigen was present in the airway epithelium as compared to SARS MA15, which causes lethal outcomes in aged mice"
Why were experiments with SL-SHC014-MA15 chimeric virus were later restricted?,as gain of function (GOF) studies under the US government-mandated pause policy 
Why is there  no credible evidence to support the claim that the SARS-CoV-2 is derived from the chimeric SL-SHC014-MA15 virus?,"upon careful phylogenetic analyses by multiple international groups [5, 14] , the SARS-CoV-2 is undoubtedly distinct from SL-SHC014-MA15, with >6,000 nucleotide differences across the whole genome."

What was reported in  a rebuttal paper led by an HIV-1 virologist Dr. Feng Gao?, they used careful bioinformatics analyses to demonstrate that the original claim of multiple HIV insertions into the SARS-CoV-2 is not HIV-1 specific but random 
What happened to the report with initial claims?," Because of the many concerns raised by the international community, the authors who made the initial claim have already withdrawn this report."
What is the difference between evolution and synthetic constructs?,"Evolution is stepwise and accrues mutations gradually over time, whereas synthetic constructs would typically use a known backbone and introduce logical or targeted changes instead of the randomly occurring mutations that are present in naturally isolated viruses such as bat CoV RaTG13."
What is the conclusion of this report?, there is currently no credible evidence to support the claim that SARS-CoV-2 originated from a laboratory-engineered CoV. It is more likely that SARS-CoV-2 is a recombinant CoV generated in nature between a bat CoV and another coronavirus in an intermediate animal host. 
What is the conclusion of this report?,"More studies are needed to explore this possibility and resolve the natural origin of SARS-CoV-2. We should emphasize that, although SARS-CoV-2 shows no evidence of laboratory origin, viruses with such great public health threats must be handled properly in the laboratory and also properly regulated by the scientific community and governments."

What are important criteria for selecting vaccine delivery vectors?,"long-lasting cellular and (where appropriate) humoral immune responses to the vectored antigen must be induced following administration of these vaccines, preferably with a single dose"
What happens when a recipient of a vaccine has immune response to the delivery vector?,"considering a vector such as Salmonella, if a host has previously been infected there will exist robust B and T memory responses, and as such, when a vaccination is delivered, an anamnestic response to the Salmonella antigens will be induced (while the response to the vectored antigen will be a primary response)"
What is the effect of host immune response to the delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination?,"for virally vectored antigens, the existence of pre-existing immunity to the vector (particularly neutralizing antibody) will restrict delivery of the virus into cells, thereby effectively reducing the dose of the vectored antigen. Again, this might be expected to result in a reduction in the antigenicity of the vectored antigen."
What is the effect of host immune response to the delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination?,"theoretically reduce the exposure of the heterologous antigen to the immune system, as the vector is rapidly cleared."
What is an example  of the effect of immunity to the  delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination?,"mice that had been primed with Salmonella alone, and then boosted with Salmonella expressing tetC, induced much lower anti-tetC responses than mice that had not been primed. This argues strongly that prior immunological immunity to the vector can seriously dampen subsequent antigen-specific humoral responses."
What is the effect of host immune response to viral delivery vectors in the efficacy of vaccination?,"pre-existing immunity is a major obstacle of many viralvectored vaccines, such as Ad serotype 5 or herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), where the rate of seroprevalence to these viruses is very high [40-45 % and 70 % (or more) of the US population, respectively] "
What is the effect of host immune response to  the viral delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination?,"Vector-specific antibodies may impede the induction of immune responses to the vaccine-encoded antigens, as they may reduce the dose and time of exposure of the target cells to the vaccinated antigens"
What is the effect of host immune response to the delivery vector on  the efficacy of vaccination?," In a large-scale clinical trial (STEP) of an Ad serotype 5 (AdHu5)-based HIV-1 vaccine, the vaccines showed a lack of efficacy and tended to increase the risk of HIV-1 infection in vaccine recipients who had pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to AdHu5 ("
What are methods to avoid the effect vector immunity on the efficacy of vaccination?," the use of vectors derived from nonhuman sources, using human viruses of rare serotypes (Kahl et al., 2010; Lasaro & Ertl, 2009) , heterologous prime-boost approaches (Liu et al., 2008) , homologous reimmunization (Steffensen et al., 2012) and removing key neutralizing epitopes on the surface of viral capsid proteins (Gabitzsch & Jones, 2011; Roberts et al., 2006) "
What are methods to  avoid the effect of vector immune response on the efficacy of vaccination?,"The inhibitory effect of pre-existing immunity can also be avoided by masking the Ad vector inside dendritic cells (DCs) (Steffensen et al., 2012) . In addition, mucosal vaccination or administration of higher vaccine doses can overcome pre-existing immunity problems (Alexander et al., 2012; Belyakov et al., 1999; Priddy et al., 2008; Xiang et al., 2003) ."
"How does cell-mediated immunity to viral delivery vector, reduce the immune response to vaccine?"," this is because viruses will induce neutralizing antibody on the first dose, and in subsequent doses this antibody will limit the number of transduced cells, therefore limiting the responses. This is particularly a problem with a common viral vector such as Ad, where a large proportion of the population will have immunological memory against common serotypes"
"How can vectors for which host has immunity, be used differently to increase the efficacy of vaccination?"," it will be possible to utilize such vectors only by developing vaccines from alternative serotypes. It may be that a vector such as Pre-existing immunity against vaccine vectors attenuated influenza virus, with the ability to easily develop reassortants, will be useful in this context.In addition, immunological memory in the form of opsonizing antibody certainly plays an important role in the early uptake of Salmonella by macrophages and DC. This may be beneficial, as the live bacterial vector used for delivery purposes harbours mutations in genes encoding proteins responsible for their survival in the animal host. This not only encumbers their ability to cause disease, making them safe live vectors, but also limits the number of replications. The presence of opsonizing antibodies should mean a higher level of bacterial uptake, leading to higher presentation to the immune system and therefore a better immune response."

What is the conclusion of  this report?," heightened immune responses limit pathogen-induced cellular morbidity, which can facilitate the establishment of rapidly-propagating persistent infections within-host. Rapidly-transmitting viruses that have evolved with bat immune systems will likely cause enhanced virulence following emergence into secondary hosts with immune systems that diverge from those unique to bats."
Why  have bats received attention in recent years?,"for their role as reservoir hosts for emerging viral zoonoses, including rabies and related lyssaviruses, Hendra and Nipah henipaviruses, Ebola and Marburg filoviruses, and SARS coronavirus "
What difference bats demonstrate compared to most non-Chiropteran mammals?,"no obvious disease symptoms upon infection with pathogens that are highly virulent in non-volant mammals (Schountz et al., 2017) but may, instead, support viruses as longterm persistent infections, rather than transient, immunizing pathologies"
What suite of species-specific mechanisms do bats have to limit viral load?,"host receptor sequence incompatibilities for some bat-virus combinations (Ng et al., 2015; Takadate et al., 2020) and constitutive expression of the antiviral cytokine"
How are mammalian cells typically rendered antiviral?," the presence of viral RNA or DNA in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells will induce secretion of type I interferon proteins (IFN-a and IFN-b), which promote expression and translation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in neighboring cells "
"In non-flying mammals, what what would be elicited by IFN expression upon viral infection?",widespread inflammation and concomitant immunopathology upon viral infection
What do the bats do instead?,bats support unique adaptations to combat inflammation
Why may the bats have this unique adaptation?,to mitigate metabolic damage induced during flight
Why  was the field of virus dynamics developed?,"to describe the mechanistic underpinnings of long-term patterns of steady-state viral load exhibited by patients in chronic phase infections with HIV, who appeared to produce and clear virus at equivalent rates "
How are bats connected to fatal viral diseases?,"bats are natural reservoirs for viruses that have some of the highest fatality rates of any viruses that people acquire from wild animals -including rabies, Ebola and the SARS coronavirus."
What is  an example of anti-viral defense in bats?,some bats have an antiviral immune response called the interferon pathway perpetually switched on
What would be caused by  this hyper-vigilance in most other mammals?, harmful inflammation
How are bats different?,"Bats, however, have adapted anti-inflammatory traits that protect them from such harm, include the loss of certain genes that normally promote inflammation."
What bat species cells were compared?,"-the black flying fox -in which the interferon pathway is always on, and another -the Egyptian fruit bat -in which this pathway is only activated during an infection."
What was the conclusion of the study ?," In both bat species, the strongest antiviral responses were countered by the virus spreading more quickly from cell to cell. This suggests that bat immune defenses may drive the evolution of faster transmitting viruses, and while bats are well protected from the harmful effects of their own prolific viruses, other creatures like humans are not."
What would be the benefit of learning more about bat's defenses and how they  drive virus evolution?,"help scientists develop better ways to predict, prevent or limit the spread of viruses from bats to humans. "

We used generalized additive models to infer the time course of all cell culture replicates and construct the multi-trial dataset to which we eventually fit our mechanistic transmission model for each cell line-virus-specific combinatio"
How was the modeling carried out?,an innovative combination of in vitro experimentation and within-host modeling to explore the impact of unique bat immunity on virus dynamics.
What was the finding in this study?,"that bat cell lines demonstrated a signature of enhanced interferon-mediated immune response, of either constitutive or induced form, which allowed for establishment of rapid within-host, cell-to-cell virus transmission rates "
What supports the results?,"by both data-independent bifurcation analysis of our mean field theoretical model, as well as fitting of this model to viral infection time series established in bat cell culture."
What was additionally demonstrated?,"the antiviral state induced by the interferon pathway protects live cells from mortality in tissue culture, resulting in in vitro epidemics of extended duration that enhance the probability of establishing a long-term persistent infection."
What do  the studies suggest?,that viruses evolved in bat reservoirs possessing enhanced IFN capabilities could achieve more rapid within-host transmission rates without causing pathology to their hosts. Such rapidly-reproducing viruses would likely generate extreme virulence upon spillover to hosts lacking similar immune capacities to bats.
What was the methodology for this study?,"we first developed a novel, within-host, theoretical model elucidating the effects of unique bat immunity, then undertook bifurcation analysis of the model's equilibrium properties under immune absent, induced, and constitutive assumptions. We considered a cell line to be constitutively immune if possessing any number of antiviral cells at disease-free equilibrium but allowed the extent of constitutive immunity to vary across the parameter range for "", the constitutive rate of antiviral acquisition. "
What was demonstrated in deriving the equation for R 0?," invasion threshold is elevated at high values of constitutive antiviral acquisition,"
What is a conclusion of the modeling?,"Constitutive immune processes can thus prohibit pathogen invasion, while induced responses, by definition, can only control infections post-hoc."
What is a conclusion of the study?,"Regardless of mechanism (induced or constitutive), interferon-stimulated antiviral cells appear to play a key role in maintaining longer term or persistent infections by safeguarding susceptible cells from rapid infection and concomitant cell death. "
What do  fits to rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 cells suggest?,"that the constitutive IFN-a expression characteristic of P. alecto cells may represent more of a constitutive immune priming process than a perpetual, functional, antiviral defense."
What do the findings indicate?,enhanced IFN-mediated immune pathways in bat reservoirs may promote elevated within-host virus replication rates prior to cross-species emergence. 
What is presented in this study?,"general methods to study cross-scale viral dynamics, which suggest that within-host persistence is supported by robust antiviral responses characteristic of bat immune processes. "
What is a conclusion of  this study?, Viruses which evolve rapid replication rates under these robust antiviral defenses may pose the greatest hazard for cross-species pathogen emergence into spillover hosts with immune systems that differ from those unique to bats.

"In addition to oral swabs, which tests detected the presence of 2019-nCOV virus?",the 2109-nCoV RNA was readily detected in the blood (6 of 57 patients) and the anal swabs (11 of 28 patients). 
What  is the relationship between the presence of virus in blood and anal swabs and disease severity?,"all of the 6 patients with detectable viral RNA in the blood cohort progressed to severe symptom stage, indicating a strong correlation of serum viral RNA with the disease severity (p-value = 0.0001). Meanwhile, 8 of the 11 patients with annal swab virus-positive was in severe clinical stage."
Which patients were classified as severe in Chinese guidelines?,"Patients who were with at least one of the following symptom should be diagnosed to be severe case, 1) distress of respiratory with respiratory rate > = 30/min; 2) Oxygen saturation < = 93% in the rest state, and 3) arterial oxygen tension (PaO₂) over inspiratory oxygen fraction (FIO₂) of less than 300 mm Hg. In the blood detection cohort (Figure 1 (A)), patients who had at less one serum sample measurement with the PCR method were included. "
What is the relationship between the presence of virus in blood sample and disease severity?," In the 57, 6 cases were detected to be blood positive, all of them (100%) were severe in symptom requiring special care attention, and the blood of the rest 51 cases was without detectable virus in the blood, only 12 of them (23.5%) were severe cases."

What could be the implication of 2019-nCOV virus in anal swabs?,digestive tract might be one extrapulmonary site for virus replication
What  could account for the high transmission rate of the 2019-nCOV virus?,"Intensive structural analysis of the S protein of 2019-nCoV with the SARS-Coronavirus suggested that several critical residues in the viral spike protein might confer favourable interaction with human ACE2 [7] . Of note, ACE2 is also abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the small intestine besides the respiratory tract and is ubiquitously present in endothelial cells [8] , which might provide possible routes of transmission, and might account for the high transmission capacity of the new virus. "
What could account for the dissemination of the 2019-nCOV virus across the whole body?,"We propose that rampant coronavirus replication in pulmonary alveolus results in the breakdown of the alveolar vessel and the subsequent virus leakage into the blood flow, through which the virus is disseminated across the whole body. Then the virus succeeds in establishing reinfection in the digestive tract by using the highly expressed ACE2 receptor, which exacerbated the disease vice versa"

"Before linking respiratory viruses, what was linked to acute exacerbations?","Despite being a major cause of exacerbation, reports linking respiratory viruses to acute exacerbations only start to emerge in the late 1950s (Pattemore et al., 1992) ; with bacterial infections previously considered as the likely culprit for acute exacerbation "
What did the advent of PCR technology lead to?, viruses were recovered during acute exacerbations events and reports implicating their role emerged in the late 1980s

What other viruses are implicated in acute exacerbations but to a much lesser extent?,"parainfluenza virus (PIV), influenza virus (IFV) and adenovirus (AdV)"
What other viruses have been recently reported as contributing to acute exacerbations?," viruses including bocavirus (BoV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), certain coronavirus (CoV) strains, a specific enterovirus (EV) strain EV-D68, human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV)"
What are the common feature of these viruses share?,"they can infect both the upper and/or lower airway, further increasing the inflammatory conditions in the diseased airway"
Where do the respiratory viruses primarily infect and replicate?,within airway epithelial cells 
What happens  during the replication process?,the cells release antiviral factors and cytokines that alter local airway inflammation and airway niche 
What does the inflammation lead to in healthy airways?,leads to type 1 inflammatory responses consisting of activation of an antiviral state and infiltration of antiviral effector cells. This eventually results in the resolution of the inflammatory response and clearance of the viral infection 
How may the responses be different in a chronically inflamed airway?," the responses against the virus may be impaired or aberrant, causing sustained inflammation and erroneous infiltration, resulting in the exacerbation of their symptoms (Mallia and Johnston, 2006; Dougherty and Fahy, 2009; Busse et al., 2010; Britto et al., 2017; Linden et al., 2019) . This is usually further compounded by the increased susceptibility of chronic airway inflammatory disease patients toward viral respiratory infections, thereby increasing the frequency of exacerbation as a whole"
What will the review focus on?,compiling and collating the current known mechanisms of viral-induced exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases; as well as linking the different viral infection pathogenesis to elucidate other potential ways the infection can exacerbate the disease
How will this review serve?,to provide further understanding of viral induced exacerbation to identify potential pathways and pathogenesis mechanisms that may be targeted as supplementary care for management and prevention of exacerbation.
Why is this approach significant?,due to the current scarcity of antiviral drugs for the management of viral-induced exacerbations.
What happens upon infection?,viruses evoke an inflammatory response as a means of counteracting the infection.
How does the infected airway cell respond?,"Generally, infected airway epithelial cells release type I (IFNα/β) and type III (IFNλ) interferons, cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, RANTES, macrophage inflammatory protein 1α (MIP-1α) and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) (Wark and Gibson, 2006; Matsukura et al., 2013) ."
What  does the epithelial proteins cause?,"enable infiltration of innate immune cells and of professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) that will then in turn release specific mediators to facilitate viral targeting and clearance, including type II interferon (IFNγ), IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-12 (Wark and Gibson, 2006; Singh et al., 2010; Braciale et al., 2012) ."
What is the effect of these factors?,"These factors heighten local inflammation and the infiltration of granulocytes, T-cells and B-cells (Wark and Gibson, 2006; Braciale et al., 2012) . The increased inflammation, in turn, worsens the symptoms of airway diseases."
What additional effects are caused  in patients with asthma and patients with CRS with nasal polyp ?,"viral infections such as RV and RSV promote a Type 2-biased immune response (Becker, 2006; Jackson et al., 2014; Jurak et al., 2018) . This amplifies the basal type 2 inflammation resulting in a greater release of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, RANTES and eotaxin and a further increase in eosinophilia, a key pathological driver of asthma and CRSwNP"
What is the result of increased eosinophilia?,worsens the classical symptoms of disease and may further lead to life-threatening conditions due to breathing difficulties
What are the effects for patients with COPD and patients with CRS without nasal polyp (CRSsNP) ?,"are more neutrophilic in nature due to the expression of neutrophil chemoattractants such as CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 (Cukic et al., 2012; Brightling and Greening, 2019) . The pathology of these airway diseases is characterized by airway remodeling due to the presence of remodeling factors such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) released from infiltrating neutrophils (Linden et al., 2019) . Viral infections in such conditions will then cause increase neutrophilic activation; worsening the symptoms and airway remodeling in the airway thereby exacerbating COPD, CRSsNP and even CRSwNP in certain cases "
 Which are the type 2 inflammatory cytokines expressed by the epithelial cells upon injury to the epithelial barrier?," IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP "
Which cells lacking both B and T cell receptors but play a crucial role in secreting type 2 cytokines to perpetuate type 2 inflammation when activated ?, ILC2s are a group of lymphoid cells
What is the effect cell death and injury to the epithelial barrier due to infection?,"induce the expression of IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP, with heighten expression in an inflamed airway"
What happens when the 3 cytokines are expressed?,"These 3 cytokines then work in concert to activate ILC2s to further secrete type 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 which further aggravate the type 2 inflammation in the airway causing acute exacerbation ("
What  happens in the case of COPD?," increased ILC2 activation, which retain the capability of differentiating to ILC1, may also further augment the neutrophilic response and further aggravate the exacerbation"
What happens during viral infection of healthy individuals?," these factors are not released to any great extent and do not activate an ILC2 response during viral infection in healthy individuals (Yan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2018a) ; despite augmenting a type 2 exacerbation in chronically inflamed airways (Jurak et al., 2018) . These classical mechanisms of viral induced acute exacerbations are summarized in Figure 1 "
What happens upon viral infection in the airway?,antiviral state will be activated to clear the invading pathogen from the airway. Immune response and injury factors released from the infected epithelium normally would induce a rapid type 1 immunity that facilitates viral clearance. 
What is the effect of the inflammation of the airway?," However, in the inflamed airway, the cytokines and chemokines released instead augmented the inflammation present in the chronically inflamed airway, strengthening the neutrophilic infiltration in COPD airway, and eosinophilic infiltration in the asthmatic airway. The effect is also further compounded by the participation of Th1 and ILC1 cells in the COPD airway; and Th2 and ILC2 cells in the asthmatic airway."
What increases the severity of exacerbations in the airway?,the synergistic effect of viral infection with other sensitizing agents 
Why viruses do not need to directly infect the lower airway to cause an acute exacerbation?,he nasal epithelium remains the primary site of most infections.
what is suggested by the fact that  not all viral infections of the airway lead to acute exacerbations?,"a more complex interplay between the virus and upper airway epithelium which synergize with the local airway environment in line with the ""united airway"" hypothesis "
What is the effect of chronic airway inflammatory disease  in patients?,viral infections or their components persist in patients
What is the effect of chronic airway inflammatory disease?,may further alter the local environment and contribute to current and future exacerbations

What is highlighted by the authors in this review?," recent data regarding viral interactions with the airway epithelium that could also contribute to, or further aggravate, acute exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory diseases."
Who has impaired or reduced ability of viral clearance ?,Patients with chronic airway inflammatory diseases 
What does their impairment stems from?,a type 2-skewed inflammatory response which deprives the airway of important type 1 responsive CD8 cells that are responsible for the complete clearance of virusinfected cells 
Where is this  especially evident?,in weak type 1 inflammation-inducing viruses such as RV and RSV
What are other  effects?,"there are also evidence of reduced type I (IFNβ) and III (IFNλ) interferon production due to type 2-skewed inflammation, which contributes to imperfect clearance of the virus resulting in persistence of viral components, or the live virus in the airway epithelium "
What is the  effect of viral components remaining in the airway?,"antiviral genes such as type I interferons, inflammasome activating factors and cytokines remained activated resulting in prolong airway inflammation"
What do these factors do?,"enhance granulocyte infiltration thus prolonging the exacerbation symptoms. Such persistent inflammation may also be found within DNA viruses such as AdV, hCMV and HSV, whose infections generally persist longer (Imperiale and Jiang, 2015) , further contributing to chronic activation of inflammation when they infect the airway"
What is also linked with the chronic inflammation that precedes the malignancies?,"human papilloma virus (HPV), a DNA virus highly associated with head and neck cancers and respiratory papillomatosis,"
What should be investigated in the future?," the role of HPV infection in causing chronic inflammation in the airway and their association to exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory diseases, which is scarcely explored"
What further can viral persistence lead to?,"viral persistence which lead to continuous expression of antiviral genes may also lead to the development of steroid resistance, which is seen with RV, RSV, and PIV infection"
What  effect the use of steroids to  suppress inflammation can have?,may also cause the virus to linger longer in the airway due to the lack of antiviral clearance
What should be further focus of research?,The concomitant development of steroid resistance together with recurring or prolong viral infection 
Which viruses may not cause prolonged inflammation due to strong induction of antiviral clearance?,"viruses that induce strong type 1 inflammation and cell death such as IFV (Yan et al., 2016; Guibas et al., 2018) and certain CoV (including the recently emerged COVID-19 virus)"
What do these infections cause?,"massive damage and cell death to the epithelial barrier, so much so that areas of the epithelium may be completely absent post infection (Yan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2019) . Factors such as RANTES and CXCL10, which recruit immune cells to induce apoptosis, are strongly induced from IFV infected epithelium "
What do the necroptotic factors such as RIP3 do?," further compounds the cell deaths in IFV infected epithelium . The massive cell death induced may result in worsening of the acute exacerbation due to the release of their cellular content into the airway, further evoking an inflammatory response in the airway "
What  may the destruction of the epithelial barrier  cause?, further contact with other pathogens and allergens in the airway which may then prolong exacerbations or results in new exacerbations.
What may the epithelial destruction cause?,"may also promote further epithelial remodeling during its regeneration as viral infection induces the expression of remodeling genes such as MMPs and growth factors . Infections that cause massive destruction of the epithelium, such as IFV, usually result in severe acute exacerbations with non-classical symptoms of chronic airway inflammatory diseases."
What is recommended that patients with chronic airway inflammatory disease?, receive their annual influenza vaccination as the best means to prevent severe IFV induced exacerbation.
What is another mechanism that viral infections use to drive acute exacerbations?,the induction of vasodilation or tight junction opening factors which may increase the rate of infiltration. 
What does infection of respiratory viruses cause?,disruption of tight junctions with the resulting increased rate of viral infiltration. This also increases the chances of allergens coming into contact with airway immune cells.
What is an example of this?," IFV infection was found to induce oncostatin M (OSM) which causes tight junction opening (Pothoven et al., 2015; Tian et al., 2018) . Similarly, RV and RSV infections usually cause tight junction opening which may also increase the infiltration rate of eosinophils and thus worsening of the classical symptoms of chronic airway inflammatory diseases "
"What are also associated with viral infections and pneumonia development, which may worsen inflammation in the lower airway?", the expression of vasodilating factors and fluid homeostatic factors such as angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) and bactericidal/permeabilityincreasing fold-containing family member A1 (BPIFA1)
What is another area of interest?,the relationship between asthma and COPD exacerbations and their association with the airway microbiome.
What is usually linked with the development of chronic airway inflammatory diseases?,specific bacterial species in the microbiome which may thrive in the inflamed airway environment 
What follows  in the event of a viral infection such as RV infection?," the effect induced by the virus may destabilize the equilibrium of the microbiome present (Molyneaux et al., 2013; Kloepfer et al., 2014; Kloepfer et al., 2017; Jubinville et al., 2018; van Rijn et al., 2019) . In addition, viral infection may disrupt biofilm colonies in the upper airway (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae) microbiome to be release into the lower airway and worsening the inflammation"
What does the viral infection alter?,the nutrient profile in the airway through release of previously inaccessible nutrients that will alter bacterial growth
What is  the destabilization is further compounded by?," impaired bacterial immune response, either from direct viral influences, or use of corticosteroids to suppress the exacerbation symptoms"
What does all this gradually lead to?,"more far reaching effect when normal flora is replaced with opportunistic pathogens, altering the inflammatory profiles "
Why do these changes may  result in more severe and frequent acute exacerbations ?,due to the interplay between virus and pathogenic bacteria in exacerbating chronic airway inflammatory diseases 
How effective are microbiome based  trial therapies?, have shown efficacy in the treatments of irritable bowel syndrome by restoring the intestinal microbiome (
What can viral infections cause?,"the disruption of mucociliary function, an important component of the epithelial barrier. "
Which is the primary contact/infection site of most respiratory viruses?,The upper airway epithelium
"What does the destruction of epithelial barrier, mucociliary function and cell death of the epithelial cells do?",serves to increase contact between environmental triggers with the lower airway and resident immune cells.
What are viral infections are usually accompanied with?,oxidative stress which will further increase the local inflammation in the airway. 
What is the dysregulation of inflammation can be further compounded by?,modulation of miRNAs and epigenetic modification such as DNA methylation and histone modifications that promote dysregulation in inflammation
What does  the change in the local airway environment and inflammation promote?,growth of pathogenic bacteria that may replace the airway microbiome. 
What does the the inflammatory environment dispersal of upper airway commensals into the lower airway cause?,"inflammation and alteration of the lower airway environment, resulting in prolong exacerbation episodes following viral infection. "
Which are the most commonly  studied viruses in chronic airway inflammatory diseases?,"RV, RSV, and IFV"
What do the infections such as RSV are shown to do?, to directly destroy the cilia of the ciliated cells and almost all respiratory viruses infect the ciliated cells

What was the case fatality rate in the 1918 Spanish Influenza epidemic?,"Case-fatality rates were >2.5%, compared to <0.1% in otherinﬂuenza pandemics"
What was the death toll in the 1918-1919 Spanish Influenza epidemic?,Total deaths were estimated atz50 million (577) and were arguably as high as 100 mil-lion 
Are the modern day Influenza viruses related to the 1918 Spanish Influenza virus?," All inﬂuenza A pandemics since that time, andindeed almost all cases of inﬂuenza A worldwide (except-ing human infections from avian Viruses such as H5N1 andH7N7), have been caused by descendants of the 1918Virus, including “drifted” H1N1 Viruses and reassortedH2N2 and H3N2 Viruses."
Why is the Spanish Influenza virus the Mother of the modern influenza viruses?,"The latter are composed of keygenes from the 1918 Virus, updated by subsequently-incor—porated avian inﬂuenza genes that code for novel surface *Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rockville, Maryland, USA;and TNational Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USAproteins, making the 1918 Virus indeed the “mother” of allpandemics."
When was it  determined that the 1918  pandemic was caused by the H1N1 Influenza virus?,"That question did not begin to be resolved until the 1930s,when closely related inﬂuenza Viruses (now known to beH1N1 Viruses) were isolated, ﬁrst from pigs and shortlythereafter from humans. Seroepidemiologic studies soonlinked both of these viruses to the 1918 pandemic"
Did the Spanish Influenza or Swine flu or the H1N1 virus disappear in humans for some time?," descendants of the 1918Virus still persists enzootically in pigs. They probably alsocirculated continuously in humans, undergoing gradualantigenic drift and causing annual epidemics, until the1950s. With the appearance of a new H2N2 pandemicstrain in 1957 (“Asian ﬂu”), the direct H1N1 Viral descen-dants 0f the 1918 pandemic strain disappeared from humancirculation entirely, although the related lineage persistedenzootically in pigs."
When did the Swine Flu (Spanish Influenza) virus reappear in humans?," But in 1977, human H1N1 Virusessuddenly “reemerged” from a laboratory freezer (9). Theycontinue to circulate endemically and epidemically."
What descendant  lineages of the swine flu (Spanish Influenza) virus were identified in 2006?," 2 major descendant lineages of the 1918H1N1 Virus, as well as 2 additional reassortant lineages,persist naturally: a human epidemic/endemic H1N1 line-age, a porcine enzootic H1N1 lineage (so-called classicswine ﬂu), and the reassorted human H3N2 Virus lineage,which like the human H1N1 Virus, has led to a porcineH3N2 lineage."
Are the modern descendant influenza viruses as dangerous as the 1918 parent swine flu (Spanish Influenza) H1N1 virus?,"None of these Viral descendants, however,approaches the pathogenicity of the 1918 parent Virus."
How dangerous are the modern H1N1 (swine flu) and the H3N2 (Influenza A) viruses compared  to the 1918 H1N1 (swine flu Spanish Influenza)  viruses?,"the human H1N1 and H3N2 lin-eages have both been associated with substantially lowerrates ofillness and death than the virus of 1918. In fact, cur-rent H1N1 death rates are even lower than those for H3N2lineage strains (prevalent from 1968 until the present)."
"Are the descendant H1N1 strains of the 1918 H1N1 swine flu (Spanish Influenza) virus, still prevalent?","H1N1 Viruses descended from the 1918 strain, as well as H3N2 Viruses, have now been cocirculating worldwide for29 years and show little evidence of imminent extinction."
Is the origin and epidemiology of the 1918 swine flu (Spanish Influenza) known?,"ongoing studies to map Virulencefactors are yielding interesting results. The 1918 sequencedata, however, leave unanswered questions about the ori-gin of the Virus (19) and about the epidemiology of thepandemic."
What is the geographical origin of the H1N1 swine flu ?,"Historical and epidemiologic data are inade-quate to identify the geographic origin of the Virus (21),and recent phylogenetic analysis of the 1918 Viral genomedoes not place the Virus in any geographic context"
Is the geographical origin of the 1918 H1N1 swine flu known?,"Confounding deﬁnite assignment of a geographicpoint of origin, the 1918 pandemic spread more or lesssimultaneously in 3 distinct waves during an z12-monthperiod in 191871919, in Europe, Asia, and North America(the ﬁrst wave was best described in the United States inMarch 1918)"
What is an unique feature of the 1918 swine flu?,the simultaneous (or nearly simultaneous) infectionof humans and swin
What season or  time of the year do the new strains of influenza emerge?,"Historical records since the 16th century suggest thatnew inﬂuenza pandemics may appear at any time of year,not necessarily in the familiar annual winter patterns ofinterpandemic years,"
"Once appeared, when do the influenza like diseases occur in subsequent years?","confronted by the selection pressures of population immu-nity, these pandemic Viruses begin to drift genetically andeventually settle into a pattern of annual epidemic recur-rences caused by the drifted Virus variants."
When did the first wave of the H1N1 swine flu (Spanish Influenza) occur?," a ﬁrst or spring wavebegan in March 1918 and spread unevenly through theUnited States, Europe, and possibly Asia over the next 6months"
What was the death rate in the first wave of the 1918 swine flu pandemic?," Illness rates were high, but death ratesin most locales were not appreciably above normal."
When were the second and the third wave of the 1918-1919 swine flu pandemic?," A sec-ond or fall wave spread globally from September toNovember 1918 and was highly fatal. In many nations, athird wave occurred in early 1919 "
What was the primary difference between the first wave and the 2nd and 3rd wave of the 1918-1919 swine flu pandemic?,"the much higher fre-quency of complicated, severe, and fatal cases in the last 2waves."
Why the human influenza viruses do not disappear after herd immunity is developed?,"The occurrence, and to some extent the severity, of recur-rent annual outbreaks, are driven by Viral antigenic drift,with an antigenic variant Virus emerging to become domi-nant"
What are the circumstances that promote the spread of influenza virus?," lower environ-mental temperatures and human nasal temperatures (bene-ﬁcial to thermolabile Viruses such as inﬂuenza), optimalhumidity, increased crowding indoors, and imperfect ven-tilation due to closed windows and suboptimal airﬂow"
Do seasonal temperatures and humidity explain  the appearance of the three waves of the 1918 swine flu?,"such factors cannot explain the 3 pandemicwaves of 1918-1919, which occurred in the spring-sum-mer, summer—fall, and winter (of the NorthernHemisphere), respectively. The ﬁrst 2 waves occurred at atime of year normally unfavorable to inﬂuenza Virusspread. The second wave caused simultaneous outbreaksin the Northern and Southern Hemispheres fromSeptember to November. "
Which virus samples  from the 1918 swine flu pandemic have been identified?,pandemic Virus samples we haveyet identiﬁed are from second-wave patients
Are viruses in the first and third waves of the 1918 swine flu pandemic same or derived from the virus from the second wave of the swine flu?,"nothingcan yet be said about whether the ﬁrst (spring) wave, or forthat matter, the third wave, represented circulation of thesame Virus or variants of it"
Was the 1918 swine flu virus novel to humans are was it derived from older viruses?,"Viral sequence data now suggest that the entire 1918Virus was novel to humans in, or shortly before, 1918, andthat it thus was not a reassortant Virus produced from oldexisting strains that acquired 1 or more new genes"
Do avian flu viruses change over long periods?,"Inﬂuenza Virus genesequences from a number ofﬁxed specimens ofwild birdscollected circa 1918 show little difference from avianViruses isolated today, indicating that avian Viruses likelyundergo little antigenic change in their natural hosts evenover long periods"
What  is the typical age profile of mortality in Influenza diseases?,"The curve of inﬂuenza deaths by age at death has histor-ically, for at least 150 years, been U-shaped (Figure 2),exhibiting mortality peaks in the very young and the veryold, with a comparatively low frequency of deaths at allages in between"
What was the age profile of mortality in the 1918 swine flu?,"age-speciﬁc death rates in the1918 pandemic exhibited a distinct pattern that has not beendocumented before or since: a “W—shaped” curve, similar tothe familiar U-shaped curve but with the addition of a third(middle) distinct peak of deaths in young adults z20410years of age"
Which age group was most susceptible to die during the 1918 swine flu pandemic?,Persons 65 years of age in 1918 had a dispro-portionately high inﬂuenza incidence
What was the death rate among children during the 1918 swine flu pandemic?,"those 5 to 14years of age accounted for a disproportionate number ofinﬂuenza cases, but had a much lower death rate frominﬂuenza and pneumonia than other age groups. "
What theory provides partial explanation for the age-specific profile of the death rate in the 1918 swine flu pandemic?," the 1918 Virus had an intrinsically high Virulence, tem-pered only in those patients who had been born before1889, e.g., because of exposure to a then-circulating Viruscapable of providing partial immunoprotection against the1918 Virus strain only in persons old enough (>35 years) tohave been infected during that prior era "
Is there a difference in the pathologic feature and course of disease between modern influenza pandemics and the 1918 swine flu pandemic?," the 1918pandemic was different in degree, but not in kind, fromprevious and subsequent pandemics. Despite the extraordi-nary number of global deaths, most inﬂuenza cases in1918 (>95% in most locales in industrialized nations) weremild and essentially indistinguishable from inﬂuenza casestoday. "
Could the 1918 swine flu virus been controlled  by modern day drugs or vaccines?,the 1918 and 1918-like Viruses would beas sensitive as other typical Virus strains to the Food andDrug Administrationiapproved antiinﬂuenza drugs riman-tadine and oseltamivir.
Why was there such a high death rate in the 19118 swine flu pandemic?,"Clinically and pathologically, thesehigh death rates appear to be the result of several factors,including a higher proportion of severe and complicatedinfections of the respiratory tract, rather than involvementof organ systems outside the normal range of the inﬂuenzaVirus. Also, the deaths were concentrated in an unusuallyyoung age group"
Is the molecular basis of human adaptation of a virus understood?,"While data bearingon inﬂuenza Virus human cell adaptation (e.g., receptorbinding) are beginning to be understood at the molecularlevel, the basis for Viral adaptation to efﬁcient human-to-human spread, the chief prerequisite for pandemic emer-gence, is unknown for any inﬂuenza Virus."

Why would real  case fatality rate for the H7N9 be lower than detected rate?,"most people usually think a common cold is a very common and normal occurrence, and they don't take flu-like illnesses seriously. In most situations, they would just stay home and take some medicines. Only those who have very severe flu-like symptoms would see doctors, and thereby be detected and diagnosed, accordingly the real case fatality rate should be much lower"
