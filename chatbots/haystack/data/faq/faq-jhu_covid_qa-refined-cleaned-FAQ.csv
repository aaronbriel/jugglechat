how long does coronavirus stay on different surfaces,"A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%). ",,,,,,,,,,

coronavirus disease spread,"It is able to spread person-to-person. The spread can also be through respiratory droplets released when you sneeze, cough, or talk. Respiratory droplets may also be passed from person-to-person through commonly used surfaces such as door nobs, elevator buttons and bathroom faucets.  [[Would you like more information?]] Among viruses, some are more contagious than others; for example, measles is so contagious that if one person has it, 9 out of 10 people of ALL ages around them will also become infected if they are not protected. COVID-19 is able to spread easily in the community, which is called ""community spread"".   [[Would you like more information on how you can avoid getting infected with the virus that causes Covid19?]] Socially distancing is a practice that aims to prevent those who are sick from coming into contact with those who are healthy. This is to reduce the opportunity for disease transmission. It means avoiding crowds, mass gatherings, and maintaining at least a 6 foot distance fom others. This means no handshakes, hugs, or high-fives. It is also important to practice frequent hand-washing with soap and water or an alcohol-based (at least 60%) hand sanitizer.",,,,,,,,,,

[[Would you like to know more about COVID-19 symptoms?]]",,,,,,,,,,
what is the coronavirus caused by,"There are many types of coronaviruses. Some only cause illness in people, and some only infect animals. COVID-19 is likely due to an animal coronavirus being able to infect and spread among people. In the past, there was Middle East Respiratory Syndrom (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory (SARS) which are both coronaviruses that came from animals and spread among people.   [[Would you like more information on MERs?]] MERs is Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. It is also caused by coronavirus, similar to COVID-19. This virus was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. Their symptoms are severe acute respiratory illness which includes fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The virus does not pass easily person-to-person unless there is close contact, which includes providing unprotected care to a patient.  [[Would you like more information?]] SARS is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. It was identified in 2003. It is thought to be an animal virus, though the animal source has not yet been identified. It transmits person-to-person, and has influenza-like symptoms, which include fever, malaise, headaches, diarrhea, and shivering. Currently, SARS-CoV is not being transmitted anywhere in the world. Since the 2003 epidemic, it has appeared four times due to laboratory accidents.",,,,,,,,,,
Is this virus comparable to SARS or to the seasonal flu?,"The novel coronavirus detected in China is genetically closely related to the SARS-CoV-1 virus. SARS emerged at the end of 2002 in China, and it caused more than 8 000 cases in 33 countries over a period of eight months. Around one in ten of the people who developed SARS died.. . The current COVID-19 outbreak caused around 7 000 reported cases in China during the first month after initial reports (January 2020), with a further 80 000 cases reported globally during the second month (February 2020). Of these first 87 000 cases, about 3 000 died. Cases are now being detected in Europe and across the globe. See the situation updates for the latest available information. . . While the viruses that cause both COVID-19 and seasonal influenza are transmitted from person-to-person and may cause similar symptoms, the two viruses are very different and do not behave in the same way. ECDC estimates that between 15 000 and 75 000 people die prematurely due to causes associated with seasonal influenza each year in the EU, the UK, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. This is approximately 1 in every 1 000 people who are infected. By comparison, the current estimated mortality rate for COVID-19 is 20-30 per 1 000 people.. . Despite the relatively low mortality rate for seasonal influenza, many people die from the disease due to the large number of people who contract it each year. The concern about COVID-19 is that, unlike influenza, there is no vaccine and no specific treatment for the disease. It also appears to be as transmissible as influenza if not more so. As it is a new virus, nobody has prior immunity which in theory means that the entire human population is potentially susceptible to COVID-19 infection.","<p>The novel coronavirus detected in China is genetically closely related to the SARS-CoV-1 virus.

Does covid transfer through air,"COVID-19 is being spread through respiratory droplets that come from coughing or sneezing. If these droplets from an infected person reach another person through the nose, eyes, or mouth it can transmit the disease. It isn't airborne in the same way measles is, but it does linger in the air for some amount of time. However, we are still not sure how long it is in the air for, when the virus particles will rest on the ground or surrounding surfaces, and how it helps transmit to other people.",,,,,,,,,,

We have not seen anything related to spread through food. For the surfaces of frozen foods and other food product packaging - because of the poor survivalbility of the coronaviruses on these surfaces, it is a very low risk of spread. However, it is important to make sure you wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds to practice general food safety. Please also continue to wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.",,,,,,,,,,

What does it mean to be isolated?,"This means the person has been instructed to separate themselves from others, to avoid spreading COVID-19 further with others. If you live with other people, it will be important to be separated from them as much as possible so COVID-19 does not spread to them as well.   [[Would you like more information?]] If the infected person lives with others, it'll be important that they stay in another room, or be separated from others as much as possible. Preferably, they should have a separate bedroom and bathroom if that is available. Prohibit visitors who do not have an essential need to be in the home. The infected person should not care for any pets in the home. Handwash regularly with soap and water or with a handsanitizer that contains 60-95% alcohol. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid sharing household items (like dishes, cups, towels, bedding) with the infected person.

Wearing a mask when you are not ill may give a false sense of security. There is a potential risk of infection with improper mask use and disposal. They also need to be changed frequently.  However, your health care provider may recommend you wear a mask if you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 while you are seeking or waiting for care. In this instance, masks are an appropriate part of infection prevention and control measures. The mask acts as a barrier and helps stop the tiny droplets from spreading you when you cough or sneeze.",,,,,,,,,,

How long does the virus survive on a surface like a doorknob?,"A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through.

Can I catch the coronavirus by eating food handled or prepared by others,"Right now, our current understanding of how COVID-19 spreads is person-to-person through respiratory droplets. We have not seen anything related to spread through food. For the surfaces of frozen foods and other food product packaging - because of the poor survivalbility of the coronaviruses on these surfaces, it is a very low risk of spread. However, it is important to make sure you wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds to practice general food safety.

"What personal protective equipment (PPE) should be worn by individuals transporting patients who are confirmed with or under investigation for COVID-19 within a healthcare facility? For example, what PPE should be worn when transporting a patient to radiology for imaging that cannot be performed in the patient room?","In general, transport and movement of the patient outside of  their room should be limited to medically essential purposes. If being transported outside of the room, such as to radiology, healthcare personnel (HCP) in the receiving area should be notified in advance of transporting the patient. For transport, the patient should wear a facemask to contain secretions and be covered with a clean sheet.. . If transport personnel must prepare the patient for transport (e.g., transfer them to the wheelchair or gurney), transport personnel should wear all recommended PPE (gloves, a gown, respiratory protection that is at least as protective as a fit-tested NIOSH-certified disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirator or facemask—if a respirator is not available—and eye protection [i.e., goggles or disposable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face]). This recommendation is needed because these interactions typically involve close, often face-to-face, contact with the patient in an enclosed space (e.g., patient room). Once the patient has been transferred to the wheelchair or gurney (and prior to exiting the room), transporters should remove their gown, gloves, and eye protection and perform hand hygiene.. . If the patient is wearing a facemask, no recommendation for PPE is made typically for HCP transporting patients with a respiratory infection from the patient's room to the destination. However, given current limitations in knowledge regarding COVID-19 and following the currently cautious approach for risk stratification and monitoring of healthcare personnel caring for patients with COVID-19, use of a facemask by the transporter is recommended for anything more than brief encounters with COVID-19 patients. Additional PPE should not be required unless there is an anticipated need to provide medical assistance during transport (e.g., helping the patient replace a dislodged facemask).. . After arrival at their destination, receiving personnel (e.g., in radiology) and the transporter (if assisting with transfer) should perform hand hygiene and wear all recommended PPE. If still wearing their original respirator or facemask, the transporter should take care to avoid self-contamination when donning the remainder of the recommended PPE.

[[Would you like more information on MERs?]] MERs is Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. It is also caused by coronavirus, similar to COVID-19. This virus was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. Their symptoms are severe acute respiratory illness which includes fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The virus does not pass easily person-to-person unless there is close contact, which includes providing unprotected care to a patient.  [[Would you like more information?]] SARS is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. It was identified in 2003. It is thought to be an animal virus, though the animal source has not yet been identified. It transmits person-to-person, and has influenza-like symptoms, which include fever, malaise, headaches, diarrhea, and shivering. Currently, SARS-CoV is not being transmitted anywhere in the world.

How does COVID-19 get transmitted? ,"It is able to spread person-to-person. The spread can also be through respiratory droplets released when you sneeze, cough, or talk. Respiratory droplets may also be passed from person-to-person through commonly used surfaces such as door nobs, elevator buttons and bathroom faucets.  [[Would you like more information?]] Among viruses, some are more contagious than others; for example, measles is so contagious that if one person has it, 9 out of 10 people of ALL ages around them will also become infected if they are not protected. COVID-19 is able to spread easily in the community, which is called ""community spread"".   [[Would you like more information on how you can avoid getting infected with the virus that causes Covid19?]] Socially distancing is a practice that aims to prevent those who are sick from coming into contact with those who are healthy.

how long does the coronavirus stay on surfaces,"A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%). ",,,,,,,,,,
Why do I have to stay at home?,"Socially distancing is a practice that aims to prevent those who are sick from coming into contact with those who are healthy. This is to reduce the opportunity for disease transmission. As COVID-19 spreads person-to-person in close contact, we want to reduce the chance of infection amongst populations that are vulnerable. This includes older adults (over the age of 65) and those with suppressed immune systems. It is also to help reduce the burden on healthcar esystems and workers, as there are not enough workers and beds to care for patients if everyone were to have COVID-19 at the same time.",,,,,,,,,,
can coronavirus spread to animals,"Although the current spread and growth of the COVID-19 outbreak is primarily associated with spread from person to person, experts agree that the virus likely originated from bats and may have passed through an intermediary animal source (currently unknown) in China before being transmitted to humans.  It is recommended that individuals who travel to avoid contact with animals, including wild meat and wet (live animal) markets.  If you are considering travel, check the latest travel health notices for the most up-to-date travel advice prior to travelling.  Importers, rescue organizations and adoptive families should limit or postpone importing animals from affected areas. If animals are imported from an affected area: they should be closely monitored for signs of illness, you should contact a veterinarian if they become sick, and call ahead to ensure they are aware of the circumstances",,,,,,,,,,
can coronavirus travel in packages,"The risk is quite low for one to become infected with COVID19 through mail/packages - especially because it takes time for mail to be sent (over a period of a few days or weeks). However, it is still recommended practice to wash hands with soap and water or with an alcohol (at least 60%) based hand sanitizer. For packages, open and discard of them outside of the home if possible, and wash hands thoroughly.",,,,,,,,,,

coronavirus is caused by,"There are many types of coronaviruses. Some only cause illness in people, and some only infect animals. COVID-19 is likely due to an animal coronavirus being able to infect and spread among people. In the past, there was Middle East Respiratory Syndrom (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory (SARS) which are both coronaviruses that came from animals and spread among people.   [[Would you like more information on MERs?]] MERs is Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. It is also caused by coronavirus, similar to COVID-19. This virus was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. Their symptoms are severe acute respiratory illness which includes fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The virus does not pass easily person-to-person unless there is close contact, which includes providing unprotected care to a patient.  [[Would you like more information?]] SARS is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. It was identified in 2003. It is thought to be an animal virus, though the animal source has not yet been identified. It transmits person-to-person, and has influenza-like symptoms, which include fever, malaise, headaches, diarrhea, and shivering. Currently, SARS-CoV is not being transmitted anywhere in the world.

what has caused it,"There are many types of coronaviruses. Some only cause illness in people, and some only infect animals. COVID-19 is likely due to an animal coronavirus being able to infect and spread among people. In the past, there was Middle East Respiratory Syndrom (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory (SARS) which are both coronaviruses that came from animals and spread among people.   [[Would you like more information on MERs?]] MERs is Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. It is also caused by coronavirus, similar to COVID-19. This virus was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. Their symptoms are severe acute respiratory illness which includes fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The virus does not pass easily person-to-person unless there is close contact, which includes providing unprotected care to a patient.  [[Would you like more information?]] SARS is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. It was identified in 2003. It is thought to be an animal virus, though the animal source has not yet been identified. It transmits person-to-person, and has influenza-like symptoms, which include fever, malaise, headaches, diarrhea, and shivering. Currently, SARS-CoV is not being transmitted anywhere in the world. Since the 2003 epidemic, it has appeared four times due to laboratory accidents.",,,,,,,,,,
is coronavirus like sars,"SARS-CoV-2 refers to the virus that causes COVID-19. COVID-19 is the disease itself. The virus has a different name for the disease to support the development of diagnostic testing, vaccines, and medicines. The disease is named as such to enable discussion on disease prevention, spread, its ability to transmit, its severity, and its treatment.",,,,,,,,,,
how long does the coronavirus live on hard surfaces,"A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%). ",,,,,,,,,,
How do I know if I have Covid-19,"If you have developed symptoms like fever, cough, and/or difficulty breathing, and you have been in close contact with a person known to have COVID-19, or they have recently traveled to an area with ongoing spread of COVID-19, yes. Stay home and call your health care provider. Older patients and individuals who have severe underlying medical conditions should contact their healthcare providers earlier, even if the illness seems mild. If your symptoms are severe - like you are having persistent pain/pressure in chest, new confusion or inability to arouse, or bluish lips or face, contact healthcare provider or go to the emergency room - it is important to seek care immediately.

Self-monitoring means to monitor yourself for 14 days for symptoms of respiratory illness, such as fever, cough, and diffculty breathing and to avoid crowded places and increase your personal space from others whenever possible. You need to self-isolate if you have no symptoms and may have been exposed to COVID-19 as a result of travelling outside of Canada within the last 14 days or coming in close contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19 and have been asked to do so by your Public Health Authority. Self-isolation means to stay at home, monitor yourself for symptoms, even if mild, for 14 days, and to avoid contact with others.",,,,,,,,,,

How do I know if I am following the rules of social distancing correctly,"Social distancing is one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak, but it is sometimes hard to understand what this means given the vague language. What it means is to stay at home as much as possible, and limit your outside exposure. This does mean meaking changes to your everyday routine to minimize contacts with others, including:   avoiding non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes avoiding crowded places such as concerts, arenas, conferences and festivals limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 6 feet) from others  For example - if you need to go grocery shopping, limit to once a week. If you go on walks, make sure you maintain a 6 foot distance between yourself and others.",,,,,,,,,,

Is take out food really safe during pandemic,"Right now, our current understanding of how COVID-19 spreads is person-to-person through respiratory droplets. We have not seen anything related to spread through food. For the surfaces of frozen foods and other food product packaging - because of the poor survivalbility of the coronaviruses on these surfaces, it is a very low risk of spread. However, it is important to make sure you wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds to practice general food safety. Please also continue to wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.",,,,,,,,,,

What caused COVID-19? ,"There are many types of coronaviruses. Some only cause illness in people, and some only infect animals. COVID-19 is likely due to an animal coronavirus being able to infect and spread among people. In the past, there was Middle East Respiratory Syndrom (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory (SARS) which are both coronaviruses that came from animals and spread among people.   [[Would you like more information on MERs?]] MERs is Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. It is also caused by coronavirus, similar to COVID-19. This virus was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. Their symptoms are severe acute respiratory illness which includes fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The virus does not pass easily person-to-person unless there is close contact, which includes providing unprotected care to a patient.  [[Would you like more information?]] SARS is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. It was identified in 2003. It is thought to be an animal virus, though the animal source has not yet been identified. It transmits person-to-person, and has influenza-like symptoms, which include fever, malaise, headaches, diarrhea, and shivering. Currently, SARS-CoV is not being transmitted anywhere in the world. Since the 2003 epidemic, it has appeared four times due to laboratory accidents.",,,,,,,,,,

These are: having trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion or inability to arouse, and/or bluish lips or face. You also may be at higher risk from COVID19 if you are over the age of 65, live in a nursing home or long-term care facility, or have other high-risk conditions (e.g. chronic lung disease, serious heart conditions, asthma, immunocomprimised, severe obesity, diabetes, etc.) ",,,,,,,,,,
Can someone who has been quarantined for COVID-19 spread the illness to others?,"Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease. Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure, because 14 days is the longest incubation period seen for similar coronaviruses. Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.","<p>Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease.

how long does the coronavirus stay in your system,"A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%). ",,,,,,,,,,

does wearing mask protect me from covid 19,"Masks are only helpful in preventing people who have coronavirus (COVID19) from spreading it to others. If the person is healthy, there is likely no need for them to wear a face mask - as there is little evidence showing that these masks used by healthy people will prevent transmission to public.   If the person is coughing, sneezing, and exhibiting other symptoms of COVID-19, wearing a mask can be recommended. It is also recommended for those who are caring for someone who has or is suspected to have COVID-19. However, masks are only really effective if it is used in combination with frequent hand-washing with soap and water, or with an alcohol-based sanitizer.",,,,,,,,,,

Will social distancing slow the spread of covid 19,"Social distancing is one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak, but it is sometimes hard to understand what this means given the vague language. What it means is to stay at home as much as possible, and limit your outside exposure. This does mean meaking changes to your everyday routine to minimize contacts with others, including:   avoiding non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes avoiding crowded places such as concerts, arenas, conferences and festivals limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 6 feet) from others  For example - if you need to go grocery shopping, limit to once a week. If you go on walks, make sure you maintain a 6 foot distance between yourself and others.",,,,,,,,,,
What are symptoms of Covid 19,"Reported illnesses have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness and death from confirmed COVID-19 cases. Confirmed means that these people were tested positive for COVID-19. These are the symptoms that can appear 2 to 14 days after exposure: fever, cough, shortness of breath, pneumonia in both lungs. Those who are infected with COVID-19 may also have little to no symptoms.   However, if you're experiencing difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion or inability to arouse, and/or bluish lips or face - please seek medical attention immediately. This is not an all inclusive list - if you are experiencing symptoms that are severe or concerning, talk to your medical provider.",,,,,,,,,,
how long does the coronavirus live on surfaces,"A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days.

On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through.

Should the general population wear masks to protect themselves from COVID-19?,"If you are a healthy individual, the use of a mask is not recommended for preventing the spread of COVID-19.  Wearing a mask when you are not ill may give a false sense of security. There is a potential risk of infection with improper mask use and disposal. They also need to be changed frequently.  However, your health care provider may recommend you wear a mask if you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 while you are seeking or waiting for care. In this instance, masks are an appropriate part of infection prevention and control measures.

coronavirus are caused by,"There are many types of coronaviruses. Some only cause illness in people, and some only infect animals. COVID-19 is likely due to an animal coronavirus being able to infect and spread among people. In the past, there was Middle East Respiratory Syndrom (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory (SARS) which are both coronaviruses that came from animals and spread among people.   [[Would you like more information on MERs?]] MERs is Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. It is also caused by coronavirus, similar to COVID-19. This virus was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. Their symptoms are severe acute respiratory illness which includes fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The virus does not pass easily person-to-person unless there is close contact, which includes providing unprotected care to a patient.  [[Would you like more information?]] SARS is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. It was identified in 2003. It is thought to be an animal virus, though the animal source has not yet been identified. It transmits person-to-person, and has influenza-like symptoms, which include fever, malaise, headaches, diarrhea, and shivering. Currently, SARS-CoV is not being transmitted anywhere in the world.

Should travelers wear facemasks?,"CDC recommends that everyone wear a mask over their nose and mouth when in public, including during travel. Masks slow the spread of COVID-19 because they help keep people who are infected from spreading respiratory droplets to others when they cough, sneeze, or talk. Medical masks and N-95 respirators are for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance. Some people shouldn't wear masks: Children younger than 2 years old, Anyone who has trouble breathing, Anyone who is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without help","<p>CDC recommends that everyone wear a mask over their nose and mouth when in public, including during travel.

what is coronavirus and what does it do,"Coronavirus are a type of virus - there are many kinds, and some of them can cause disease. Examples of coronaviruses include the common cold, flu, to more severe diseases like Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).   COVID19 is a novel coronavirus that has been recently identified.   [[Would you like more information on COVID19?]] [[Would you like to know the symptoms of COVID19?]]    ",,,,,,,,,,
How contagious is the virus?,"Yes. It is actively spreading person to person. The CDC recommends that those who have COVID-19 are isolated either at a hospital or at home, depending on how sick they are, until they are no longer at risk of infecting others.",,,,,,,,,,
Should I stay home?,"Socially distancing is a practice that aims to prevent those who are sick from coming into contact with those who are healthy. This is to reduce the opportunity for disease transmission. As COVID-19 spreads person-to-person in close contact, we want to reduce the chance of infection amongst populations that are vulnerable. This includes older adults (over the age of 65) and those with suppressed immune systems. It is also to help reduce the burden on healthcar esystems and workers, as there are not enough workers and beds to care for patients if everyone were to have COVID-19 at the same time.",,,,,,,,,,
What do Funeral Home Workers need to know about handling decedents who had COVID-19?,"A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19. Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19. If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected. For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.). Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag.. . Embalming can be conducted. During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g. disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and facemask). Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturer's label. Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin.

what is novel coronavirus 2019 ncov,"COVID-19 is a new coronavirus that we have not seen previously; it is not the same as the flu or common cold. Coronaviruses are types of viruses that cause illnesses. These include the common cold, flu, to more severe diseases like Middle East Respiratory Syndrom (MERs-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).   [[Would you like to know more about COVID-19 symptoms?]]",,,,,,,,,,
How long does the virus live on surfaces,"A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%). ",,,,,,,,,,
what states is the coronavirus in the usa,"Yes, all states have reported COVID-19 infections. U.S. case counts are updated regularly Mondays through Fridays. Please click here to see current U.S. case count: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html",,,,,,,,,,
coronavirus come from bat soup,"It was first found in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The first cases are linked to a live animal market but now COVID-19 is able to spread person-to-person.",,,,,,,,,,
how coronavirus is transmitted from animals to humans,"There is currently no evidence to suggest that this virus is circulating in animals in Canada.  It is possible that some types of animals can be infected with COVID-19 but there is no evidence that pets or other animals can spread the virus. There are still many unknowns about COVID-19 and this is an area that remains to be studied and understood.  Until we know more, if you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have a pet or other animal: avoid close contact with them, do not snuggle or kiss them, or let them lick you, sit on your lap, or sleep in your bed, practice good cough etiquette, avoid coughing and sneezing on your animals, have another member of your household care for your animals (if this is not possible, always wash your hands before touching or feeding them), and limit your animal's contact with other people and animals (this may mean keeping them indoors)  To date, there have not been any reports of livestock being infected by COVID-19 anywhere. However, livestock producers should follow normal biosecurity measures as always. This includes limiting visitors or workers who may have travelled to, or been in contact with, someone from an affected area.",,,,,,,,,,
What is the risk of infection when traveling by plane?,"If it is established that a COVID-19 case has been on an airplane, other passengers who were at risk (as defined by how near they were seated to the infected passenger) will be contacted by public health authorities. Should you have questions about a flight you have taken, please contact your local health authority for advice. The risk of being infected on an airplane cannot be excluded, but is currently considered to be low for an individual traveller. The risk of being infected in an airport is similar to that of any other place where many people gather..

what is social distancing?,"Social distancing is one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak, but it is sometimes hard to understand what this means given the vague language. What it means is to stay at home as much as possible, and limit your outside exposure. This does mean meaking changes to your everyday routine to minimize contacts with others, including:   avoiding non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes avoiding crowded places such as concerts, arenas, conferences and festivals limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 6 feet) from others  For example - if you need to go grocery shopping, limit to once a week. If you go on walks, make sure you maintain a 6 foot distance between yourself and others.",,,,,,,,,,
Get I get infected from a dog?,"While this virus did emerge from an animal source, it is only passing person-to-person currently. Currently, there is no evidence that shows a pet can become sick with COVID-19... but animals can spread disease to people, and people can spread disease to animals. So it is important to always wash your hands before and after interacting with animals.",,,,,,,,,,

how coronavirus spread in hindi,"It is able to spread person-to-person. The spread can also be through respiratory droplets released when you sneeze, cough, or talk. Respiratory droplets may also be passed from person-to-person through commonly used surfaces such as door nobs, elevator buttons and bathroom faucets.  [[Would you like more information?]] Among viruses, some are more contagious than others; for example, measles is so contagious that if one person has it, 9 out of 10 people of ALL ages around them will also become infected if they are not protected. COVID-19 is able to spread easily in the community, which is called ""community spread"".   [[Would you like more information on how you can avoid getting infected with the virus that causes Covid19?]] Socially distancing is a practice that aims to prevent those who are sick from coming into contact with those who are healthy. This is to reduce the opportunity for disease transmission. It means avoiding crowds, mass gatherings, and maintaining at least a 6 foot distance fom others. This means no handshakes, hugs, or high-fives. It is also important to practice frequent hand-washing with soap and water or an alcohol-based (at least 60%) hand sanitizer.",,,,,,,,,,
Can it survives on food?,There is currently no evidence to suggest that food is a likely source or route of transmission of the virus. Scientists and food safety authorities across the world are closely monitoring the spread of COVID-19.,,,,,,,,,,
