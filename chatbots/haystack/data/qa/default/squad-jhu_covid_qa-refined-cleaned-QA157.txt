IF NO ACCESS TO HAND SANITIZER: wash your hands frequently and thoroughly (this is the smartest thing you can do to prevent the spread of viruses), make sure that if you are able to buy a lesser-known brand of hand sanitizer that isn't Purell, it’s made of at least 60% alcohol, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (C.D.C.) (rules out some of the so-called “botanical” options and popular kid-friendly options), make sure that if you decide to try and make your own hand sanitizer, it also contains at least 60% alcohol. This recipe (two parts rubbing alcohol, one part aloe) sounds like it should achieve 60% alcohol. Keep in mind that some recipes call for using liquor (like vodka), which is usually 40% alcohol, and might not reach the threshold you need. For instance, Tito’s Vodka has been urging people not to use its product in DIY sanitizer solutions.
