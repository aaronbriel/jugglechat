There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19. The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). This occurs through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Older adults and people who have severe underlying chronic medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness. Every person has a role to play. So much of protecting yourself and your family comes down to common sense: . . Washing hands with soap and water.. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.. Avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue or your elbow.. Avoiding close contact with people who are sick.. Staying away from work, school or other people if you become sick with respiratory symptoms like fever and cough.. Following guidance from public health officials.. Please consult with your health care provider about additional steps you may be able to take to protect yourself..
