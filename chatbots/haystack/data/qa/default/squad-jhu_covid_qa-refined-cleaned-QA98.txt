There is so much that we do not know about COVID-19 and how it spreads, which can be scary. We are basing some of our understanding of how COVID-19 behaves on how previous coronaviruses (e.g. MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV behaves). Because of their poor survivability on surfaces, it is likely very low risk of spread from those products - and there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 through imported goods.
