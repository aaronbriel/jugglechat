Isolation refers to separating people who are sick from those who are healthy to limit and stop the spread of a disease.  Quarantine refers to separating people who are well that may have been exposed to COVID-19 and seeing if they end up developing it. They may have been exposed to it and don't know, or they may have it and not show symptoms (also known as asymptomatic carriers). This also helps limit spread of disease.
