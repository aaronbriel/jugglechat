Take Off Your Mask Carefully, When You're Home. Untie the strings behind your head or stretch the ear loops. Handle only by the ear loops or ties. Fold outside corners together. Place mask in the washing machine (learn more about how to wash masks). Be careful not to touch your eyes, nose, and mouth when removing and wash hands immediately after removing.
