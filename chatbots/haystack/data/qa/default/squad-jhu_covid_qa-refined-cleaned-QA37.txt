Quarantine is recommended for the period of time that it takes COVID-19 to develop after being exposed. Currently, the quarantine period is 14 days, or two weeks, from date of possible exposure. It is 14 days because that is what the period of time has been for other coronaviruses.   Currently, someone who has been released from quarantine is not at risk of spreading it to others because they did not develop COVID-19 during that period.
