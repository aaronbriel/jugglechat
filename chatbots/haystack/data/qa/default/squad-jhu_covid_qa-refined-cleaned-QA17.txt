The CDC guidance currently says it is okay to release someone from isolation if they have met the following requirements:  * The individual has no more fever without use of fever-reducing medications  * The individual no longer showing symptoms like the cough * The individual has tested negative on at least two tests that have been collected at least 24 hours apart
