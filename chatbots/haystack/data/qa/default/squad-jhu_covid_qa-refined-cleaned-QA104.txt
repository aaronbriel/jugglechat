Handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is the best way to protect yourself and your family from getting sick! This is important to do regularly - everytime you wash your hands - but especially after blowing your nose, coughing, sneezing, going to the restroom, and before eating or preparing food? If you do not have soap and water available, please use an alcohol based hand sanitizer that has at least 60% alcohol.
