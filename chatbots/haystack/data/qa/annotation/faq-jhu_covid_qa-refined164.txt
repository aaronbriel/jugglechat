CDC recommends that everyone wear a mask over their nose and mouth when in public, including during travel. Masks slow the spread of COVID-19 because they help keep people who are infected from spreading respiratory droplets to others when they cough, sneeze, or talk. Medical masks and N-95 respirators are for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance. Some people shouldn't wear masks: Children younger than 2 years old, Anyone who has trouble breathing, Anyone who is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without help
