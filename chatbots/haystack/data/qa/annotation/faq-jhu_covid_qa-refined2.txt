Reported illnesses have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness and death from confirmed COVID-19 cases. Confirmed means that these people were tested positive for COVID-19. These are the symptoms that can appear 2 to 14 days after exposure: fever, cough, shortness of breath, pneumonia in both lungs. Those who are infected with COVID-19 may also have little to no symptoms.   However, if you're experiencing difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion or inability to arouse, and/or bluish lips or face - please seek medical attention immediately. This is not an all inclusive list - if you are experiencing symptoms that are severe or concerning, talk to your medical provider.
