There are many types of coronaviruses. Some only cause illness in people, and some only infect animals. COVID-19 is likely due to an animal coronavirus being able to infect and spread among people. In the past, there was Middle East Respiratory Syndrom (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory (SARS) which are both coronaviruses that came from animals and spread among people.   [[Would you like more information on MERs?]] MERs is Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. It is also caused by coronavirus, similar to COVID-19. This virus was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. Their symptoms are severe acute respiratory illness which includes fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The virus does not pass easily person-to-person unless there is close contact, which includes providing unprotected care to a patient.  [[Would you like more information?]] SARS is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. It was identified in 2003. It is thought to be an animal virus, though the animal source has not yet been identified. It transmits person-to-person, and has influenza-like symptoms, which include fever, malaise, headaches, diarrhea, and shivering. Currently, SARS-CoV is not being transmitted anywhere in the world. Since the 2003 epidemic, it has appeared four times due to laboratory accidents.
