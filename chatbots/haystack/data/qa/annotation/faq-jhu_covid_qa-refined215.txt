Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home. If you're sick, stay at home except when you need to get medical care. If you experience difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion or inability to arouse, bluish lips or face... get medical attention immediately. Please keep in mind that this is not the full list and if you're experciencing severe symptoms or something you are concerned by, please contact your medical provider.   If possible, use a separate room and bathroom for the sick household member. It will be important to make sure you clean and sanitize your hands and home (including sick room and bathroom) regularly. Provide the sick family member with clean disposable face masks to wear at home so that they are less able to spread COVID-19 to you. Avoid sharing personal items like utensils, foods, and drinks.
