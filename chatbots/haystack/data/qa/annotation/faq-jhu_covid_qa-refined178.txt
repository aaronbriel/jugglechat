It is important to daily practice actions that will not only reduce your chances of getting sick, but also of those around you. Practice habits to keep you and your family safe.   Please avoid close contact with those who are sick. When you are sick, stay at home - except when getting medical care. Cover your coughs and sneezes with tissues, and throw the tissue away. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, sneezing, using the restroom, and before eating or preparing food. If you don't have soap and water, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that has at least 60% alcohol. ALWAYS wash your hands with soap and water if your hands are visibly dirty. Please also clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces (e.g. tables, countertops, light switches, door knobs, cabinet handles).
