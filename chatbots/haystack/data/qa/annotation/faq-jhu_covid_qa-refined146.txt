If you are using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in their sample. In early stages, it is possible that the virus will not be detected. For COVID-19, a negative result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness.
