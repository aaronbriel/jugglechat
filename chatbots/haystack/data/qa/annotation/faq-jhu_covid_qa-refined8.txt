COVID-19 is being spread through respiratory droplets that come from coughing or sneezing. If these droplets from an infected person reach another person through the nose, eyes, or mouth it can transmit the disease. It isn't airborne in the same way measles is, but it does linger in the air for some amount of time. However, we are still not sure how long it is in the air for, when the virus particles will rest on the ground or surrounding surfaces, and how it helps transmit to other people.
