If a U.S. citizen dies outside the United States, that person's next of kin or legal representative should notify the US Consular officials at the Department of State. These people are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergenices.   If the family member, domestic partner, next of kin, or legal representative is in a different country than the deceased person, they should call the Department of State's Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington DC, from 8a-5p ET, Mon-Fri, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-444. For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends/holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer.   In addition to these steps above, the in-country of closest US embassy can also provide assistance.
