Close contact with other people means being within six feet of said person. Maintaining a six foot distance between yourself and others (who may possibly be infected) can help reduce a healthy person's risk of exposure and transmission of COVID-19. However, this is a recommended practice and does not mean that if you maintain a six foot difference from everyone, you will not get the virus.
