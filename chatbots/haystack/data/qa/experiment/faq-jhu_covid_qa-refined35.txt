If you have developed symptoms like fever, cough, and/or difficulty breathing, and you have been in close contact with a person known to have COVID-19, or they have recently traveled to an area with ongoing spread of COVID-19, yes. Stay home and call your health care provider. Older patients and individuals who have severe underlying medical conditions should contact their healthcare providers earlier, even if the illness seems mild. If your symptoms are severe - like you are having persistent pain/pressure in chest, new confusion or inability to arouse, or bluish lips or face, contact healthcare provider or go to the emergency room - it is important to seek care immediately. Your doctor will determine if you have symptoms of COVID-19 and whether you should be tested?
