Yes, your employer will continue to pay your salary. Your employer will then be entitled to reimbursement, from the Federal Land, of the sums used for the continued payment of wages. Should, contrary to expectations, your employer not pay, you are entitled to compensation from the competent authority (according to Section 56 of the Protection against Infection Act (IfSG)). In the first six weeks, this compensation will correspond to your net salary. After this period, you will receive the amount you would receive as sick pay..
