The risk is quite low for one to become infected with COVID19 through mail/packages - especially because it takes time for mail to be sent (over a period of a few days or weeks). However, it is still recommended practice to wash hands with soap and water or with an alcohol (at least 60%) based hand sanitizer. For packages, open and discard of them outside of the home if possible, and wash hands thoroughly.
