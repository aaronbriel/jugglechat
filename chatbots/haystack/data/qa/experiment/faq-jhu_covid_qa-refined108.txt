School dismissals are a method that can help slow the spread of and reduce exposure to COVID-19. Please keep up with local news media sources, as they will share information about school dismissals. If schools are dismissed, encourage your child to stay home and avoid gathering or socializing anywhere (like a friend's house, favorite restaurants, or local shopping malls).
