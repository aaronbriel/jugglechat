Currently, hospitals and family physicians decide who will be tested. They base their decision on the recommendations of the Robert Koch Institute. According to these recommendations, symptoms such as fever, a sore throat and respiratory complaints, on their own, are not sufficient. The person must additionally have had contact with an infected person, or have spent time in a region in which the virus was proven to exist over large areas.. . Testing should be done only if disease symptoms are present. If you are healthy, a test will not be able to tell you whether or not you will fall ill in the coming days. At the same time, this puts an unnecessary strain on our testing capacities.
