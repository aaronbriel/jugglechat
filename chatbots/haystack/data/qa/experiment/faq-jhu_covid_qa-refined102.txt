Personal protective equipment (PPE) are types of equipment worn to minimize exposure to hazards that can cause workplace injuries or illness. Examples include gloves, safety glasses, shoes, earplugs or muffs, hard hats, respirators, coveralls, etc. This is coming up significantly during this pandemic because there is a shortage of face masks available for health workers, who are on the frontline.
