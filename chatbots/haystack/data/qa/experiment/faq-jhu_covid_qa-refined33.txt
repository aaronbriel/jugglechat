Masks are only helpful in preventing people who have coronavirus (COVID19) from spreading it to others. If the person is healthy, there is likely no need for them to wear a face mask - as there is little evidence showing that these masks used by healthy people will prevent transmission to public.   If the person is coughing, sneezing, and exhibiting other symptoms of COVID-19, wearing a mask can be recommended. It is also recommended for those who are caring for someone who has or is suspected to have COVID-19. However, masks are only really effective if it is used in combination with frequent hand-washing with soap and water, or with an alcohol-based sanitizer.
