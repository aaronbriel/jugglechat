It is important to stay calm and put your preparedness plan into action. Please stay home if you are sick, and limit contact with others as much as possible (with at least a 6 feet distance between you and another person). It is important to stay informed about the local COVID-19 situation. Please continue to practice handwashing, cover your coughs and sneezes with tissue, and frequently clean high-touch surfaces with regular household detergent and water.   It is important to also notify your workplace ASAP if your regular work schedule will need to change. Ask to work from home or take leave if your or someone in your home gets sick with COVID-19 symptom,s or if your child's school is dismissed.   If you yourself live alone and have a chronic health condition, please reach out to friends, family, loved ones, and healthcare providers. Also ask them to check in on you.   Please also stay in touch with loved ones by phone or e-mail. This can be a lonely and isolating time, so it is important to practice self-care as well as reach out to others
