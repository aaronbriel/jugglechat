Wastewater treatment plant operations should ensure workers follow routine practices to prevent exposure to wastewater. These include using engineering and administrative controls, safe work practices, and PPE normally required for work tasks when handling untreated wastewater. No additional COVID-19â€“specific protections are recommended for employees involved in wastewater management operations, including those at wastewater treatment facilities.
