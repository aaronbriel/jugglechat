Current research links COVID-19 to certain types of bat as the original source, but does not exclude the involvement of other animals. Several types of coronaviruses can infect animals and can be transmitted to other animals and people. There is no evidence that companion animals (e.g. dogs or cats)â€¯pose a risk of infection to humans. As a general precaution, it is always wise to observe basic principles of hygiene when in contact with animals.
