SARS is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. It was identified in 2003, and first infected people in the Guangdong province of Southern China in 2002. It is thought to be an animal virus, though the animal source has not yet been identified. It transmits person-to-person, and has influenza-like symptoms, which include fever, malaise, headaches, diarrhea, and shivering. Currently, SARS-CoV is not being transmitted anywhere in the world. Since the 2003 epidemic, it has appeared four times due to laboratory accidents.   [[Would you like more information?]] SARS-CoV-2 means Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2. It is the virus that leads to the coronavirus disease, also known as COVID-19.
