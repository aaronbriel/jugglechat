Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.. Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.. Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.. Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.. Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.. Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  \u2013 especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.. Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas..  . . . . Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading. . Follow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for everyone). Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.. Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.. If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your provider of any recent travel or contact with travelers.. Why?

If being transported outside of the room, such as to radiology, healthcare personnel (HCP) in the receiving area should be notified in advance of transporting the patient. For transport, the patient should wear a facemask to contain secretions and be covered with a clean sheet.. . If transport personnel must prepare the patient for transport (e.g., transfer them to the wheelchair or gurney), transport personnel should wear all recommended PPE (gloves, a gown, respiratory protection that is at least as protective as a fit-tested NIOSH-certified disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirator or facemask\u2014if a respirator is not available\u2014and eye protection [i.e., goggles or disposable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face]). This recommendation is needed because these interactions typically involve close, often face-to-face, contact with the patient in an enclosed space (e.g., patient room). Once the patient has been transferred to the wheelchair or gurney (and prior to exiting the room), transporters should remove their gown, gloves, and eye protection and perform hand hygiene.. . If the patient is wearing a facemask, no recommendation for PPE is made typically for HCP transporting patients with a respiratory infection from the patient's room to the destination. However, given current limitations in knowledge regarding COVID-19 and following the currently cautious approach for risk stratification and monitoring of healthcare personnel caring for patients with COVID-19, use of a facemask by the transporter is recommended for anything more than brief encounters with COVID-19 patients. Additional PPE should not be required unless there is an anticipated need to provide medical assistance during transport (e.g., helping the patient replace a dislodged facemask).. . After arrival at their destination, receiving personnel (e.g., in radiology) and the transporter (if assisting with transfer) should perform hand hygiene and wear all recommended PPE. If still wearing their original respirator or facemask, the transporter should take care to avoid self-contamination when donning the remainder of the recommended PPE. This cautious approach will be refined and updated as more information becomes available and as response needs change in the United States.. . Interim guidance for EMS personnel transporting patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 is available here. EMS personnel should wear all recommended PPE because they are providing direct medical care and in close contact with the patient for longer periods of time.\n\n", "document_id": 43259}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Can the COVID-19 virus spread through sewerage systems?", "id": 44718, "answers": [{"answer_id": 45708, "document_id": 43338, "question_id": 44718, "text": "there is no evidence to date that this has occurred", "answer_start": 271, "answer_category": null}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "CDC is reviewing all data on COVID-19 transmission as information becomes available.

What masks can be useful in for the general public is reducing the amount of times a person touches their face, which means less opportunity for COVID19 to enter their body.

[[Would you like more information on MERs?]] MERs is Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. It is also caused by coronavirus, similar to COVID-19. This virus was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. Their symptoms are severe acute respiratory illness which includes fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The virus does not pass easily person-to-person unless there is close contact, which includes providing unprotected care to a patient.  [[Would you like more information?]] SARS is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. It was identified in 2003. It is thought to be an animal virus, though the animal source has not yet been identified. It transmits person-to-person, and has influenza-like symptoms, which include fever, malaise, headaches, diarrhea, and shivering. Currently, SARS-CoV is not being transmitted anywhere in the world.
