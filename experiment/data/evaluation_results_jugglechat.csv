This could have been my mistake as I may have worded the questions wrong but I think that the bot should have been able to pick out the keywords.When I asked the question about symptoms the answer that I received was kind of long-winded, I would have much preferred to receive a bullet-pointed list so I could tick off the ones that I had gotten. Instead, I received information about reported illness and getting a test before I had even seen the symptoms. In this case, I think that seeing the symptoms is the first step and them providing me information about where to get a test and how should come after.When I asked about prevention it said something like 'doing the same thing as everyone to keep healthy', while this is good in practice I don't know what measures to put in place if the bot won't tell me.The next time I asked about prevention it told me to look towards the CDC, but I'm on the chatbot for a reason.",6,6,0

The responses tend to be super fast so that's a positive but for one of the questions, the chat box was stuck on 'thinking' for longer that what I hoped it would be.
